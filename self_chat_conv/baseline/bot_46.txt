Hello, how are you fling?
Awesome!!! It is a wonderful day! And you?
Good thanks. Oops. Auto correct. Technology these days..
Lolz I like to keep things simple... Like dying my hair blue.
Oh that's quite a look. I'm too old for that. 5 grandkids now.
Wow I'm only just about to turn 29 next week sooooo... Not quite there!
Yup 65 here. Love going to the beach still though..
Me to! I'm heading out of town for spring break and going to the beach!!
Nice. I'm sure that will be fun. What music do you like?
Everything, I was just loading up a playlist for my new car(present from mom yay!).
Lucky you. I wish. I like the styx and journey. Lol.
Most underrated bands of their time!.
Yeah there is a lot of good ones. So what kind of car did you get?
A blue one? Lol I'm not into cars.
How does your new car drive? Is it fast?
It is! Seatbelts are required lol
Haha, I'd definitely make sure to wear a seatbelt if I'm in a fast car, for sure. What model and make is your new car?
It is a 2021 porsche 911. It's awesome!
Wow! That's a fancy car--I bet it's great! What's it's max speed?
200 mph! I doubt I will get to that speed though :)
Yeah, I don't imagine it's legal to drive that fast on the highway. Now, if you take it to a racetrack, I'm sure you could run it up to that speed!
That is a great idea! I will google for a local track!
I bet you'll attract a lot of attention there--you with your blue Porsche 911 going at a whopping 200 mph!
No kidding! I am hardly discrete in it!
Maybe you can even bring a few friends, or a date, around for your joyride!
Great idea! I will make some good plans for the weekend :)
That sounds like a great plan! I hope you have a great time. Do you have any plans to go to the beach this weekend?
Yes, I am going to go surfing with my grandchildren. How about you?
That sounds fun. I don't have any grandkids yet, but I'm hoping to have some someday.
I am sure you will. What is your favorite beach to surf at in california?
That's a tough one. There are so many great beaches, but if I had to pick one, I'd probably have to go with santa monica pier.
I have never been to that beach. I have only been to san diego beaches.
I haven't been there either, but it's on my list of places to visit. Have you ever been to the pacific ocean?
No, I have not. I would love to go there. Do you have any recommendations on where to go?
I've always wanted to go to hawaii. I've heard it's beautiful there.
I've never been there, but I have heard it is beautiful. What is your favorite place to travel to?
I would have to say italy. I love italian food and the people are so friendly.
I have never been to italy either. I have been to greece and turkey though.
That's so cool! What was your favorite part of turkey? I would like to travel there someday.
I loved the architecture and the food. I would love to visit italy again.
That would be so fun! I've always wanted to go to rome. Have you ever been there?
No, I haven't. It's on my list of places to visit. Do you have a favorite city in italy?
I would have to say rome is my favorite. What is your favorite italian city?
I'd have to go with rome as well. I'd love to see the colosseum and the pantheon.
That sounds like it would be a lot of fun. I have never been to italy before.
I've never been either, but I would love to go someday. I've heard it's beautiful there. What's your favorite place you've traveled to?
My favorite place so far has been greece. It was so beautiful and the food was amazing.
That sounds amazing. I love greek food. What was your favorite part of the trip?
My favorite part was visiting the ruins of the pyramids. They were amazing.
I've always wanted to go to egypt. I'd love to see the pharos.
The pharos are amazing. You should definitely go if you get the chance. I'm sure you'd love it. Do you have any pets?
I have a dog. He's a golden retriever. What kind of pets do you have?

That's a great name for a cat. My cat's names are sam and dean.
Sam is a great cat name. Dean is a good dog name. What do you do for a living?
I work as a cashier at a grocery store. It pays the bills. How about you?
That sounds like a good job. I work at a law firm as a paralegal.
That sounds interesting. How long have you been working at the law firm? Do you enjoy it?
I've been working there for a few years now. I do enjoy it, but it can be stressful at times.
That's understandable. Do you have any hobbies that you like to do in your free time?
I like to spend time with my grandchildren. We go to the beach a lot.
