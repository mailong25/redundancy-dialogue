Hey there. Just got home from fishing, what are you up to?
Cool, nothing much just finishing up some work. I just got a new job.
Oh yea? What's the new job?
I work with computer programming, what do you do?
Im a truck driver, not very glamorous I know. But I do get to travel a lot!
Cool, do you get any time off?
No, but I usually spend free time with the wife and 2 kids. How about you? Married?
No married, so no kids. I love going cruises for vacation time.
Cruises are fun! Computer programming though, so do you live in the san fran area?
Yes, with all the other computer programers!
Haha that's cool, I grew up there. Pretty different back then though.
Cool, I am trying to meet new people since I just moved here.
Where were you before san fran?
I lived in kansas city my whole life, so it's a big change.
I might go to San Francisco for my next trip
Are you coming for work or are you bringing the wife and kids?
Family trip, ive had enough work.
I hear that. Although at least you aren't stuck in an office all day. Sometimes I'd kill to be outside.
Well, being in a truck is like a tiny moving office heh. At least the scenary changes though.
Have you ever heard of the term "lot lizards"? I hear that's a truck stop thing.
Oh its a thing, and its disgusting...
Yikes, I was hoping it was just a thing from movies and not real life.
No, meth really does take its toll, especially in the smaller towns.
I wouldn't even know what meth looked like if it was right in front of me. I was a big fan of Breaking Bad though.
Haha, i dont think these people are getting walter whites quality product.
The only thing that I remember about the meth in the show was that it was blue and I thought it looked like the Miracle Grow plant fertilizer that I buy.
