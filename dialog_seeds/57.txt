Hi there, how are you doing?
I'm pretty well, how are you?
Fine, just came back from hiking in the great outdoors.
Awesome! Do you have any dogs? I have two.
I have one dog, I like to spend time with all kind of animals, love them.
Sweet! Where did you go to school? I studied in france and some in spain.
France and spain, wow. I studied here in california.
Nice! I only studied there because my father served in the navy.
I would love to go to france, I love coffee and try new ways to brew.
Nice, I'm not much of a coffee drinker. Do you like burgers?
Sure, but I am trying to eat healthy now and go outside to run, hike, and camp.
Wow, I wish I were that healthy. I really like them and fries.
I like to have as much leisure activity as I can so I started going outdoors.
That's a good idea. I grew up an only child, so outdoors would be a good idea.
What did you study in France and Spain? Specifically, what was your major that you decided on in those two countries.
My major was education, languages specifically. I wanted to learn French and Spanish while I was there so I could be a high school language teacher when I returned to the United States. Now I have been teaching for 15 years. I love it! I find it very rewarding.
That is Amazing. Did you study in Paris?
Yes, I did study in Paris. And in Spain I studied in Madrid. You mentioned that you studied in California. What did you study? Do you still live there?
I did study at UCLA. I was a marketing major and moved to New York.
Oh interesting! Which do you like more (besides the weather) New York or California?
I definitely prefer California but had a great opportunity in New York. Where in France would you recommend someone to go to see?
Paris would be a great place to do many touristy things. The fashion district in Paris is amazing. If you ever get the chance to go during fashion week, it is unreal!
