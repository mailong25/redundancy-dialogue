Hey do you have any grandchildren? I have 8.
Wow, I do not have any grandchildren yet. I love disney though!
I did watch disney on netflix last night with one of my 8 grandchildren..
Oh okay, well I have a son and we watched moa\[.
Did you find that at the library?
No, it was actually on netflix.
O when I was younger my mother would take movies from there, she worked there.
Oh okay, my mother is a dentist.
Watching movie fits me since I am very quiet person.
Oh not me, I am more of a extrovert.
Most senior citizen like me becomes quiet person over time.
I understand that, I have years until I'm a senior citizen.
My grandkids got me a subscription to Disney+ two days ago and we've been watching it nonstop.
That is great. Are there any specific shows or movies you have been watching, or just a lot in general?
I have been watching a lot in general! They have me watching something called "The Descendents" but I like the classics such as The Lion King or Aladdin
I watch those a lot with my son. We also have Disney+ but most my tv and movie watching is on Netflix.
Yes, I am used to usually watching things on Netflix. I like watching more adult series. What did you watch most recently?
I have been watching the Netflix Original Stranger Things, as well as the AMC show Breaking Bad. Both are very interesting and fun to watch in their own way.
I watched Breaking Bad, I really liked it. My favorite character is Jesse Pinkman, how about you?
Jesse was fun to watch, but my favorite had to be Walter White. Bryan Cranston did such a great job portraying him.
Yes, he is a great actor. Does your son watch that show with you? How old is he, by the way?
He is 25, so it is appropriate for him to watch it for us. I wish I had some grandkids to watch shows with, although I would have to pick a few more child friendly tv shows.
Maybe your son will give you a grandchild soon!
I can only hope, and he still has a lot of time so I will not rush him!
