Hi.
Hello!
How are you enjoying today?
It's alright I suppose. I'm at work. How about you?
What do you do? I'm also at work but I'm lucky to work from home.
I run a warehouse for a small business. It's a pretty slow day.
That sounds like it has interesting days.
Occasionally. Do you find your work interesting?
I do! I paint so I don't have a boss to report to.
Is there any way you can show me some of your work?
I can't unfortunately. What kind of hobbies do you have?
I like cycling quite a bit. And in the summer I do a lot of sailing.
So you're an outdoorsy person! That's fun.
Do you do anything outdoors?
I painted a new picture.
What was your painting of?
I went to my favorite overlook and painted it at sunset. Was pretty nice.
Wow, that sounds amazing. Do you paint the sunset often?
No not really, just at this spot the view is amazing. Sunset makes it almost magical.
I agree. The best sunset I have ever had was when I was sailing out on the sea.
Oh ive heard some crazy things on the sea with sunsets and sunrises
It is probably my happiest place to be. Where is yours?
Deep in the woods hiking, i think we both like solitude heh.
Sometimes there is nothing better than being away from other people.
I couldnt agree more really. Hows the warehouse going?
Well its a warehouse, it doesn't really get exciting. It gets run, thats all.
