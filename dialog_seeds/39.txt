Hello how are you?
Good. Do you have any hobbies?
I like to work on cars. Fords are my favorite.
Cool. My hobby would be freelancing I guess.
Did you go to college for that? I plan to go back to college. I didn't finish.
No, but I did when I was an accountant.
Cool. I grew up in a small town and prefer it my pets do too.
That's cool. My dog is my best friend!
I have cats and dogs! They hate it when I go to work at the grocery store.
Awe, poor babies! I'm ready for a new job!
Me too! I want to go back to college to get a better job.
I hear that! Being an entrepreneur isn't all I thought it would be.
I've been looking at potential colleges for when I go back, there's so much choice out there now!
There are! There are over 3,000 colleges in the United States! Which ones were you thinking of considering?
More than anything, I want a career starting college choice. What led you to accounting?
I liked numbers, but didn't like complex math. I also liked being involved with business, but didn't like the business operations or management side of things.
Hmm, I like complex problems and following a problem to a conclusion. I really want to work for someone else, I'm not a boss type of person.
Accounting might be something you could consider, then. The math isn't complex, but the accounting problems themselves can be complex.
I will certainly look into it. Is accounting the same nationwide? I might have a move in my future.
It's standardized across the US, according to US GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles).
That would make it a truly portable skill. I like that. What school did you attend?
I attended UCLA. Anderson is a pretty good business school.
Hmm, I'm not sure I would do well in a big school but I'll keep looking for something in a medium/small area.
Ah. Maybe a liberal arts college would do. Many of them offer degrees in accounting.
