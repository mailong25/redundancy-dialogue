Hey, how are you doing?
I'm good how are you?
I'm great thanks, bit tired from the kids!
Oh, how many kids do you have?
3 kids, and a full time job so I'm pretty busy all the time! How bout you?
No kids. More time to watch the sunsets during summer!
Love it! How about other family?
Just my dad. Haven't seen him in a bit with his blue dodge truck.
Ah ok. I've got a few siblings. Is it a good truck?
It runs. I don't know much about it. What kind of work do you do?
Just office stuff. Nothing very exciting. How about you?
Part time plumber. Looking for something better! Crappy job, haha!
My kids were a handful today.
Were they being bad or just too much energy?
Yes, we had a really good weather day and they were all over the place. So much energy after all the bad weather thats been keeping us inside.
At least they could burn it off outside and they had each other to play with. My mum had to deal with me alone.
Thats really hard too. I grew up with siblings but I had friends that were the only child and theres a lot of weight put on you.
As the parent you would also need to be a kid so that you can play with them. That would be very hard.
I agree. That would be very difficult for me to get my head around. What kind of stuff would you two do together.
My mum would always play games with me and run around outside. She must have been exhausted all the time.
Thats so nice of her. She did a good job. Mine just stayed in a book most of the time.
I am not sure how I will cope if I ever have children, it all sounds very hard.
Its pretty tough but like any job you get used to it and figure a schedule out. And unlike a job you can actually have fun with it.
Yes I guess you are right but it must be very strange having 3 smaller versions of yourself running around?
