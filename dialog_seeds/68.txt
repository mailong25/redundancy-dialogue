Hello, I just finished my daily run outside.
Cool, do you compete running or just stay fit.
Just do it exercise and leisure! What do you do?
I play video games, mostly with friends.
Cool, I have never played video games but I would to try.
League of legends is my favorite and alistar is my favorite champion.
I have heard of league of legends my friends play that.
Last month I bought a new gaming laptop which is really cool.
Wow, I don't enjoy computer games that much. I like to be outside.
I understand, do you do exercise other than running.
I like to swim too, I also enjoy walking my dog..
Swimming is good for you too.
How has the new gaming laptop been working for you when you play League of Legends?
It's been great. Works really well, great visuals. I know you're not a gamer, but I'd highly recommend the brand if you were ever in the market for a computer.
You are right, but all my friends like to play! I just got through with my first marathon. It was a real challenge.
Oh gosh I can only imagine! How did you feel at the end of it?
I was drained and dehydrated. I always run at a faster pace when I'm in a crowd of people and it really got to me.
I have to admit, I've never been much of a runner unless I'm being chased, lol! I do enjoy swimming, though.
That's another one of favorite activities. I'm a better runner than a swimmer however.
Swimming feels so good on my knees. They get so sore. Have you ever tried getting your dog to swim with you?
Yes! I go some in the lake and my dog loves it. I guess it is true. Dogs are man's best friend.
Haha, my poor dog is so ridiculous. She's terrified of a bath, but she loves to jump into a muddy lake.
I need to take a run or swim tomorrow before I get too lazy!!!
Now that it's getting warmer swimming will feel really good.
