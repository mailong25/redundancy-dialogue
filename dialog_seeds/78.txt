I really love eating meat, how about you?
I wish I'm a broke student.
Do you enjoy sports? I enjoy snowboarding.
I do some martial arts so yeah, whats your favorite?
Do you like comedy? Who is your favorite comedian?
I don't actually, but I do love some jiu-jitsu.
That's too bad. My favorite comedian is charlie parker.
Is he funny? You said you loved food do you like dairy?
He is funny. I do like dairy. Are you vegan?
I am because I can't even dairy foods.
Well, that's better for your health. Do you like swimming?
I do love it, it's especially fun in the summer.
I would enjoy going swimming together sometime.
I'd like that too! We might have a difficult time deciding where to have lunch though!
I know of a great vegan place by the lake. Do you prefer swimming in the lake or at a pool?
Definitely the lake. The pools get too crowded in the summer. And when I'm out of the water I can practice Jiu Jitsu on the bank to dry off.
Oh that is great! I like to practice yoga on the beach when I am out of the water. Maybe I can show you yoga, and you can teach me some Jiu Jitsu moves!
Sure! And there's a comdey club not too far from the lake. We could make a whole day of it!
Wow, that sounds like the perfect day! I thought you didn't like comedy though, you don't have to go on my behalf!
Well, I thought I might learn to like it better if there was someone with me to explain the jokes. English isn't my first language.
Oh, I didn't know that, you speak English very well! What is your first language?
A dialect of Japanese only spoken in rural parts of the country.
Wow, that is so cool! When did you move here from Japan? Do you miss it?
My family moved to america when I was 12. I do miss it.
