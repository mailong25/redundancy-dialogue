Hello, I was born in the milky way.
That sounds so cool! Just eating some jello here which is one of my fav foods.
Thats my planets main food too!!
Awesome! Do you have a family there? I've got two moms.
Yeah they live on planet x with my two moms too.
Wow. Do you have music there? I just love to hear rock music.
Of course! We receive music frequencies from earth all the time.
I have blonde hair like my mom who is a nurse. What color is yours?
Mine is grey because of the many lightyears it took me to get here.
How do you enjoy visiting earth?
Its interesting since I migrated here, a lot has changed.
For how long have you been here?
Do either of your moms enjoy eating jello?
Of course they do. How do you think I developed such a taste for it?! Do you like jello?
Of course. I grew up eating Jello three or four times every day. That's how we do it on my home planet.
Nice. I need to visit that planet! Where is your planet located?
It's part of the Milky Way but it's pretty hard to find. You have to go past the Snickers and to the right of the Heath Bar planet.
Lol, sounds like a nice place. What made you come to Earth then?
When Bill Cosby got in trouble I got called here by the Jello overlords to do some damage control. I do a lot of PR work for aliens.
Hmm, interesting. Do you like it here?
This planet is amazing. You guys are so lucky. What's your favorite planet?
I only know this one so I guess I would have to say Earth. Although, Saturn looks kind of neat from a distance.
I've only driven past Saturn, I've never stopped there. I've heard that it's basically a tourist trap and kind of expensive.
Really? I had no idea that anything even existed there.
