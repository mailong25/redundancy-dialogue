My family is awesome, what about yours?
They are good. Two brothers. You?
One sister, she has autism. My mom is awesome to care for her.
Hey thats a lot for mom to deal with. Go mom.
She taught me well, I want to be a nurse, a healer and cargiver like her.
Thats cool. I think I do not want to be a farmer like my dad.
I wouldn't want to be a farmer either. I'm from argentina, what about you?
Not from argentina. From the states, from michigan. Do you know who slartibartfast is?
Never, ever heard of it....tell me more.
Who, slartibartfast is, who. He was a character in a movie. A movie I like.
I'll have to look him up.
I recently moved to chicago. Its a nice place.
My sister just said the funniest thing to my mom!
Oh what did she say?
She asked her if oranges are called oranges because they orange or because they are a fruit.
That is funny and also very thought provoking. One of my brothers was always asking things like that when he was a younger.
I think it is because she is autistic. Her brain looks at things very black and white.
Your mom does a great job taking care of her. I know you'll be just as good of a caretaker. Are you almost done with nursing school?
Nearly, can't believe I will be out in the world looking after people on my own.
Yeah I'm sure there are a lot of hospitals hiring right now too. Do you have a place in mind where you want to work yet? You could always work in Chicago near me.
I am open to travelling anywhere really. It is something I am used to, coming from Argentina.
You're traveling more than Slartibartfast did in the Hitchhiker's Guide movies. Its nice to see the world.
I agree, you can't complain about things if you haven't seen the rest of the world.
Plus you'll be doing something to really help society. Nurses don't get enough credit for what they do.
