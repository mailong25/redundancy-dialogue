Hey there!
Hi how are you tell me about yourself.
I am pretty quiet and love to browse the web looking for deals!
Great I try to run 5 miles each day rather than spend the day inside.
I wish I could exercise more, I ve got the kids running me around all day.
How is your diet? I try to stay with meat and protiens.
I am a southern girl, bbq and I love using the crock pot.
Do you work? Im a freelance programmer.
Thats great! I am just a homemaker, seen any good movies recently?
Im not country but my parents did grow up in alaska.
Brrrrr, I am from north carolina myself.
Yea alaska is deffinetly pants weather.
How did you decide to start your diet?
I wanted to loose some weight and a friend of mine tried the Keto diet and it worked for them
I am thinking of starting a diet as well. Would you recommend Keto? I'd like to be able to use my crock pot still if I can
If you like only mostly eating proteins and no carbohydrates, it works. A crock pot is perfect for cooking up meals
I think I'll try Keto then! I'm trying to lose weight as well. Do you have any advice on how to start a running routine?
start out slowly, if you are not used to exercising, the best thing to do is just walking.
I see. I think I'll just start going on walks around the neighborhood then. I'm feeling very motivated
walking is perfect. You can even take your kids with you.
Do you want to go on a walk with me some time? I bet walking together with someone will motivate me even more
would love too. An exercise buddy is good to have
great. maybe I can work my way up to running. We can also share keto recipes
I have many keto recipes I can share
