Hi! What have you been doing today?
Pretty well. Getting warm here. How are you?
I'm doing ok. Thinking about quitting my job.
What makes you want to quit?
I work long hours for low pay and don't have enough time to spend with my family.
I used to be a veterinarian but I quit to travel so I say go for it!
Thanks for the support. What do you do now?
I just started singing for a living, and I have my own blog.

Nice. What kind of music? I like old school punk.
Folk music, a lot easier to do without a band.
Makes sense. What do you like to do on the weekends?
I hike a lot with my dog. What about you?
Where is your favorite place to travel?
My favorite travel destination that I have been to so far is the Maldives, but I am going to Bora Bora soon and i have heard great things. Do you get to travel often?
No, i barely have enough time for my family as it is with my dang job.
That is the worst when you work so hard and it just doesn't work out the way you want. I hope you can find a job with better hours and pay so you can spend some more quality time with your family.
Yeah its a bit of a struggle right now, I have to take what i can so we can survive comfortably.
What kind of work do you enjoy doing maybe you can find something that will suit you better.
I always wanted to get into woodworking as more than a hobby. I may have to just take the plunge and do it.
Maybe you could do something like that from home. Create your work and sell it to local people or online.
Yeah that is kind of what i was thinking. Hows your folk music going? Did you get a band together?
That sounds like a great plan. Yeah we are all getting together next we to iron out all the pieces so hopefully we will start creating music in the next few weeks.
Please tell me when you guys are gonna play, id love to come out!
Oh that would be amazing. Thank you for the support much appreciate it.
