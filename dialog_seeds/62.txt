Hello! Isn't it such a beautiful day out today!? How are you?
Hello! Yes it is. I am very well, and you?
I am great. Busy day, have lots of after school activities with my 3 kids today..
Oh great! I have grandchildren. They are great and bring me joy..
Yes, kids bring out the best in us!
My family and friends are amazing and I love spending time with them.
That is wonderful. I feel that way too, and about our furry family.
I like to read. What is your favorite activity?
I love farming. I live on one and enjoy tending to the earth!
Wow thats great! I love god, and worshipping him!
Do you work? My job deals with technology!
All I do know is that I would like to live near water.
How many grandchildren do you have now?
I have 5, and they're the joy of my life! How old are your kids?
11. 9. and 7. I can't wait until their old enough to give me grandchildren of my own.
It's amazing how quickly it happens! One day they're in diapers, the next they're off on their own! Cherish it while it lasts.
I do, but It's never too early to plot revenge! lol When they have kids I'm gonna fill them up with sugar and send them home to torture my kids! lol
Haha you've got quite the imagination! I forget just how much trouble those little ones can get into. Try to stay sane!
My kids are pretty good and I love them. They get pretty rambunctious at times though. Always accidentally trampling over crops.
It must be a lot of fun raising kids on a farm, though! What's the major crop you all produce?
Tomatoes which I've genetically engineered.
Wow, so you've got a green thumb, and you're tech savvy! I'm impressed!
Well, my husband does most of the growing. I just work on new breeds of crops that are resistant to trampling!
Haha if you can patent that, you'll be a very wealthy lady!
