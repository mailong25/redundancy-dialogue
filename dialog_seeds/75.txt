Good afternoon how are you doing.
I am doing well, thank you.
I am babysitting my five grandchildren.
Holy cow, you have five grandchildren? How do you do it?
Yes I love taking them to the beach even though fall is my favorite season.
Why is fall your favorite season. I love to barbecue hot dogs at the beach.
I am listening to my favorite bands styx and journey all day.
I am listening to my favorite band black sabbath. Are you into classic rock?
No, but I just tried mediterranean food and loved it.
Do you prefer beef or chicken shwarma?
I prefer chicken shwarma over beef.
Me too. I love mine with babaganoush. Dude I am not looking forward to work.
What is your favorite Black Sabbath song?
They have a lot of good songs, but my favorite would have to be Iron Man. Have you heard that one?
Yes, for sure. Was Ozzy Osbourne the lead singer at that time?
I am not 100 percent sure. I just know that I love listening to them at the beach!
My grandkids love the beach, we like to collect shells and build sand castles. I hope you don't play the music too loud when you are there.
No don't worry, only loud enough for me to hear. Although I do love the beach, I haven't gotten a chance to head down there a lot this year.
Well if you are interested, I rented a place on the beach for a month. You bring the hotdogs and we'll have a bbq and enjoy the sand.
That would be amazing, thank you! Can I also bring my family, assuming we can all get out of work? I think my nieces and nephews will get along great with your grandkids.
Sure that will be great. I love having kids around and they seem to entertain each other which leaves more time for adults to be adults.
That's right. And maybe you can play some Journey songs for me, and I'll play you some more Black Sabbath.
Either way, as long as we don't have to listen to what the kids listen to these days, we should be good. I'll send you the address later.
Thank you very much, I can't wait.
