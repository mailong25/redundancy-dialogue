Hi, I'm shelby, nice to meet you!
Hi shelby, I'm jessica! What are you up to right now?
Not much, I'm just looking at websites, to find a new house. You?
I just finished meeting some clients, so now im on lunch break and eating pizza :).
Awesome, I'm looking for something bigger, to accommodate my big family.
Nice! I wish I had a big family. I only live with my mom, a nurse.
Small families are great, too! I live with my parents still, at the beach.
Cool! Thats awesome. :) do you have any hobbies?
I love riding horses, I think they're awesome, you?
Ive never ridden a horse so thats awesome! I mostly just watch sports, like football.
I'm not much of a sports fan, I love the country though.
Country music? Ppl think im into that because im blonde, but ive never listened!
Yes, and country living, I'm thinking of buying my house in the country. :).
I heard it's beautiful in the country :) I hope you enjoy yourself!
I found a house that I really want!
Congratulations. Was it out in the country like you were hoping/
Yes, I found a lovely big house with lots of land. Perfect for y family.
Very cool. Are you thinking about homesteading or just having land to live on and away from others?
I think just having the land to stay away from everyone else at the moment. How about you? Have you ever lived in the country?
Yes, I used to live in the middle of nowhere in Mississippi. I loved the space and freedom out there. But I wanted to make more moves in my career so I moved.
That can be the problem, not always the career opportunities away from the cities. If I get a horse you will have to come and learn to ride.
Im scared of horses. Too big for me. I prefer my Golden Retriever.
That's a shame. Riding is a great way to feel part of the country. Do you have a dog or is it something you want in the future?
I have a golden retriever named maggie. Shes nine years old.
Cool name. If i had a dog I would call him Jeff.
Jeff is a good name too. Very popular these days.
