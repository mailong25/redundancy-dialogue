Hello there, how are you today?
I am doing well, thank you. And yourself?
I am good thanks for asking, how was your day?
It was tired. I am a bit of a workaholic. You?
I have to work to support my son.
It's tough. I'm trying to get out of debt, and I'm only 26!
Oh my, yup must be tough at such an early age.
You bet. What do you and your son like to do?
I like eating vegetables and he hates them with a passion.
Haha, like most kids. I like vegetables but prefer meat.
I am now teaching him how to recycle stuff.
That's great! Good for the economy!
You mentioned you're a workaholic, do you enjoy your work?
Sometimes I do, but sometimes my job as a software developer gets too stressful. Do you enjoy your job?
To me my job is a job. It is a way to support my son
I am sorry to hear that, I wish you would enjoy your job more. What is your job by the way?
I am a bookkeeper for a small company
Oh okay. Well, I'm glad you still have time even with your work to teach your son important things like recycling.
It is funny, recycling comes so natural to me. But for others it does not. My son just wants to throw everything away.
Yeah I understand, I was the exact same way when I was a kid. However, I have learned since then that it is good for the environment to recycle.
yes I agree. So how is your job coming alone?
It is paying well, so hopefully I will be able to get rid of all my debt soon.
I know you will since your are such a workaholic.
Thank you for the confidence.
