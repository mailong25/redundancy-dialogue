What's up? I just got in from a run..
Not too much just got back from fishing/.
Is it spring yet where you live?
It is, perfect weather for fishing. Do you enjoy the ocean?
I do. My parents are from alaska, so I've seen the ocean from way up north.
Oh alaska is nice, great fish there.
Great fishing and hunting too. Grandpa used to hunt caribou.
Nice, what do you do for work?
I'm a computer programmer at a tech firm. How about you?
I'm an assistant at a doctors office! But my true passion is fishing.
Do you have a fishing boat?
I do and a condo near the beach, I'm a lucky guy.
I enjoy fishing in Alaska
Is that your favorite spot? What is the biggest you have caught?
Yes, it's so peaceful. I have caught a pretty big salmon. There's nothing like camping under the Northern lights, cooking a fish you just caught over a fire.
That sounds so nice. I just cleaned my fishing boat.
Ooh, do you have a trip planned soon or was this just a regular cleaning?
Just my version of spring cleaning! But I would love to plan a trip soon
That's great. Maybe we can go fishing together and trade stories. I love being out on the water. I'm a pretty good cook, too. haha
What is your favorite meal to cook? I make a great calzone
Calzones are delicious! I love them with spinach and mushrooms. Hmm. My favorite meal would probably be soup. I love making soup. You can put anything in it and play around. That's also how I use up a lot of my leftovers. haha
That's good. I should use that trick. I hate throwing away leftovers but I get so sick of them so fast.
I hear ya. I can only eat the same thing so many times in a row. Seriously, though, just throw things in a soup! My dad would call it throw-together soup. haha Start with stock or bullion and water, pick some noodles, veggies, a meat, then add sauces/cheese/seasonings until you are happy.
That's a great idea. I always want to try a baked potato soup. Now you're making me hungry.
