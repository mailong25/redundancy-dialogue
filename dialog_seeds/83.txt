Cool, I love the wildlife but I also own a lizard.
I own a couple canines and rodents.

Lmao,thats awsome I use alotta coupons too feed my pets.
I'm working for the local government out here.
Have you fed your lizard yet?
Nah, he doesn't eat very often. How about your pets?
Yep. I feed them daily.
Do you like your dog or rodents better, if you had to choose?
That's a difficult choice to make. I guess I'd have to go for the dog, since they're probably more sentient than rodents are.
What kind of dog is he or she?
I've got a male German Shepard and a female Goldendoodle.
Oh man I'm obsessed with German Shepards. What are their names?
The German Shepard is named Peanut. The Goldendoodle is named Butter.
Oh man that's perfect. My lizards name is Franklin.
Oh, I like that! It's cool to see pets with human names!
Do you plan do get any more animals?
