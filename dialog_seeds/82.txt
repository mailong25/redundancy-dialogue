Hi. I just finished watching netflix. How are you?
I am doing well. I just completed my first marathon as I love running.
Congrats. I stay in now. I'm older and I lead a quiet life.
Thanks. I understand completely. What do you do for a living?
Tacks. Im a senior now. I have eight grand kids. So time with them..
That's very nice. Where did you grow up?
I basically grew up in a library. My mom was a librarian. How about you?
That is awesome I grew up in alaska with my parents.
That's cool. Very cold I bet. Lots of mountains.
Yes, wearing pants is my favorite. What foods do you enjoy eating?
That's cool. Pizza you?
I enjoy any type of meat.
Yeah got to love hamburger and pork.
Of course? Do you enjoy fishing?
How are you feeling after that marathon?
My legs are extremely sore, but it felt so good to cross that finish line.
That's an amazing achievement, despite the soreness! Do you plan on doing another one anytime soon?
I am definitely going to rest up from this one as I finished it recently, then I'll start training for another one that I'll do a few months down the road.
What would you suggest a novice runner do if he/she wants to prepare for a marathon? A few of my grandkids are at that age where it's a possibility.
The bigges thing is when you start training do a little more each week. You will not get to the whole 26.2 miles on your first run, so start small and work your way up
I'll let them know! One of them is way too ambitious for his own good. His eyes are bigger than his stomach, and not only when he's eating!
Haha that is too funny. Are you always ordering them pizza when they are over?
I used to, but none of their mothers approve of it! They're a health-conscious bunch!
I feel that, definitely a good thing to be health-conscious, but I got to ask. What is your favorite pizza topping?
I'm pretty simple. I just like plain old cheese and pepperoni! It's hard to mess that up!
Yes! I totally agree with you there. That is the perfect combination.
