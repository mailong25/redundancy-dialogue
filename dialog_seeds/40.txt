Hello, how are you?
Great I cant wait for easter weekend!
Same here! I get to see all eight of my grandchildren.
I hope my new blue hair matches my new easter dress.
I'm sure it will! At my old age, I don't think I could pull it off.
I turn 29 next week, I cant wait to leave for spring break.
Where are you going? My spring breaks used to be quiet and not too crazy.
My mom just gave me a new car, so ill just be driving.
Very nice! A librarian was my mother's profession.
Are you a librarian too?
I do like the quiet nature of it, but I am retired.
What do you enjoy doing in nature.
After thinking about your confidence about your hair, I've decided that I'm going to dye my hair red. How did you dye your hair?
I dyed my hair with henna actually! They make great hennas for red hair and henna is actually very good for your hair.
Thanks for the tip! I'd dye my hair blue like yours, but I'm old. I already have blue hair!
Maybe you can do a semi permanent dye and have a little fun with your grandkids, if they'd be allowed of course.
That's a great idea! If I died it purple for a while, i bet my grandkids would be shocked! I'd like to see their faces!
I think it would be a lot of fun to embrace a new hair color.
yeah, anything but grey! Getting old is no fun. Be glad you are still young!
I love grey hair though, I'm thinking of dying it a nice cool shade of grey one day!
One day nature will do it for you! lol Does your new dress match your hair?
Yes! My dress is also blue, but not quite the same shade. More like a turquoise.
Turquoise is my favorite color! Is your new car turquoise too?
I wish, it's just a boring black color. I just got my first new car, I've been driving pre owned cars before.
