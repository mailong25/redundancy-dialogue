Hello! How are you?
I am good, how about you?
Doing good. I invent things what do you do?
I'm a workaholic. Do you like music? I like listening to black sabbath.
I am more into science than music.
That's interesting. What about your hobbies?
Mainly I just invent things I like to teleport myself around the world..
Cool. I like grilling, because I like eating meat.
My current project is a time machine. Have you ever traveled in time?
I haven't. Mainly I just think about how much I have at work.
What type of work do you do?
I'm not really sure. I'm 26, so I'm just starting my career.
Do you like puppies? I adore them!
I don't really have an opinion on puppies.
Has work still been really busy? Have you gotten a chance to take a break?
Yeah I've been super busy. But I haven't been able to settle on a career just yet. Any recommendations?
Well, you could always start a band. Or you could help me build my time machine! Maybe you could be a chef?
That would be awesome! I would love to be your chef. Any particular favorite dishes?
I prefer mexican food and seafood. Chicken enchiladas, tacos, shrimp shish kabob... Any baked fish. I like it all. If you are going to grill, maybe grilled corn and stuffed burgers
Ugh that sounds like a plan. Maybe we can teleport around the world and I'll cook different types of cuisines?
Oh that would be the best thing ever! I love trying new food! Cooking is a science ya know!
Ain't that the truth! Do you have any puppies by the way?
I used to foster puppies, but I am too busy now to deal with them all the time. I do however visit shelters in every city I go to!
Oh how cool. Are you an animal person?
Of course! Puppies are my favorite, but dogs are cool too. It is nice to get to meet as many as possible while jumping from place to place. Maybe when I can move through space and time, I can go meet all the puppies from history!!
But what about the kittens???
