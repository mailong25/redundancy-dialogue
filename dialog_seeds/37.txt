As a vegan working at a community garden is important.
That's interesting! I'm not a vegan.
To each their own. Do you have pets? I have 2 dogs and a cat.
I don't have any pets, but I love puppies!
Do you like to eat puppies?
Uh, no. What do you do for a living? I'm an inventor.
I'm currently studying at community college. I want to be a nurse.
That's awesome! I just invented a teleportation device!
Do you use it to talk to puppies?
I use it to take really cheap exotic vacations. I can teleport anywhere pretty much instantly..
That sounds made up. Maybe it's all the puppies you're eating.
I'm sorry you don't believe me, because my next project is a time machine..
I'd like to try your teleportation device, can anyone use it or just you?
I'm not sure if anyone else can use it. Do you want to be my first test subject?
I don't know, it sounds exciting and scary at the same time
We could send one of your dogs through the teleportation device, but maybe that is frowned upon in vegan society?
my dog would love the attention. But I would worry about a fly being in the booth and my dog comes out half dog and half fly, lol
Hmm, that sounds like an interesting experiment. Thanks for the idea! Where do you want to be teleported to?
I think I'll skip the teleportation but I would like to try the time machine
Well I am making the time machine big enough to fit two people, so perhaps we could go on an adventure together. I could always use someone with knowledge in medicine!
That would be great. I can go back and help a lot of people who had no medicine at all.
That's a wonderful idea. I'll go back and pet all the puppies of the past.
You can go back and pet the original Lassie
Now I'm very excited. Make sure to study hard in school so we have all the knowledge we need! Oh, and bring pictures of your pets because I'm not quite sure how long we'll be gone.
