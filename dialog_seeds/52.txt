Hi there, how are you doing?
Great, just got back from skydiving... How about you?
Skydiving? Wow. I just came back from the grocery store driving my volkswagen.
We do things different in arizona, like having pet lizards lol.
I do not know much about arizona, I watch just british television.
All I know of britian I learned from reading at barnes and noble lol.
I just watch their shows but my family is from italy, my grandmother came from there.
Nice, what do you do for a living?
I am a musician, big fan of beethoven and his moonlight sonata, what about you?
Nothing so exciting, government worker lol.
Speaking of government, what is your position about gun control? I have two handguns.
Do you want me to answer that personally or professionally?
I went to a range to shoot. I find it relaxing. If you enjoy shooting, what is your favorite range?
I actually don't enjoy shooting. What do you like about it?
That's okay too. I like the experience and thrill of shooting guns and also having something to protect myself with.
I see. Have you watched any interesting new British shows?
I have not! I usually watch them because I like their accents. Have you seen any?
I recently started watching Call the Midwife. I came across the memiors its based on at Barnes and Nobles.l
I have not heard about that, but I'd love to watch it sometime with you!
It is on Netflix! There is 10 seasons.
What's the show about and have you learned anything new about Britain from it?
It is about a young woman who goes to work as a nurse in 1960s London. All sorts of things. What is your favorite Engllish show?
That sounds interesting, I'd enjoy listening to all their accents. I really like that popular show that everyone's been talking about!
Hmm which one do you mean?
