Hi there how are you today?
I'm great! How are you?
Doing good just on a job hunt currently..
Oh yes? I'm still in high school. I'm not looking forward to that.
Don't rush it.. A lot of hard work. Especially when you have a family depending on you.
I bet. I'll just enjoy my marching and concert band right now lol.
For sure! That's a cool hobby. I am more old school with my punk music then band.
I'm just a girl with english as my favorite subject...a nerd!! Hahaha.
I feel you on the nerd part. Everyone always things I am since I am a ginger.
Well, my parents are teachers so it's hard not to be lol.
I bet! Always educational in your house I'm sure. I love cook outs when I am home.
Oh cookouts are the best!! There's nothing like hot dogs on the grill!
Yes, especially in summer! Can't wait.
Same here. I'm ready for warm weather and eating outside.
What subjects do your parents teach?
My dad teaches Algebra and my mom teaches History. I like math more than history though
Your parents must be super smart, are you intelligent like them?
as some things. I'm very good at English and Math but dreadful at history. I cant seem to remember dates
Who cares about the past anyway? Lol. Do you have a favourite subject at school?
English is my favorite, what was your is school
Either art or music. I've always been really into punk music and anything creative
Im not too into punk. What bands would you recommend to get started with?
I'd recommend some ska punk to ease you into it. Less Than Jake are one of my favourites. What music do you listen to?
I listen to a lot of heavy metal like Slayer and Lamb of God. I really enjoy the talent it takes to play music at that speed and with that intensity.
Ah cool. You should listen to Choking Victim or NOFX, they might be more your style.
ive heard of NOFX but not choking victim. My freind wants me to listen to the Vandals.
