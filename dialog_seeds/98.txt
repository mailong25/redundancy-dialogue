Hi! How's it going?.
Hello, not good I just divorced my wife.
Oh no! So sorry to hear that! I'm only going to college next year.
It will be okay, I have my two pet snakes. What college.
Not sure yet, but I want to study neuroscience! What do you do?
I love to scuba dive in hawaii when I am not working.
Awesomeee! I'd love to go to hawaii. I could work on my eagle scout training.
I have been there three times, what is your training?
Oh, I'm working on becoming an eagle scout! I also volunteer at a research lab.
That is awesome, could build something for veterans?
Maybe! That would be cool, are you a veteran?.
Yes I am, I know of several eagle scout projects for veterans.
Awesome, I'd love to hear more about that.
I know of a project that help dispose of american flags correctly.
Tell me the name of your snakes.
Thier names and Hansel and Gretel - after the folk tales. I was always intrigued with that story so that's what I named them. Do you have any pets?
I do not have any pets. I have always wanted to scuba dive. What was your experience like?
I was a little nervous because of all the training and equiprments, but the guides I had in Hawaii were amazing. Once I got under the water and adjusted to breathing through the air tank - it was really funny. I can't even describe the beauty.
I really hope that I get to go one day. I can't even imagine how amazing that would be.
You will love it. Once I did it the first time, I was hooked. I even want to do that thing, where you go into a steel cage and sharks come out. I find marine life so interesting.
I think that would be amazing but I am so scared of sharks so I don't know if I would do it!
That's understandable. Apparently, I am a bit of a thrill seeker. :) I am sure you will be studying about fear/emotions in your Neuroscience classes next year.
