Hi! Tell me something about yourself!
I go to the gym on a daily basis. How about you?
Nice! I enjoy bicycling, sometimes at the gym.
That's great. I own a jeep do you drive?
I do, but I prefer to bike places. What do you do?
A music producer. My wife is a lawyer and yourself?
Well that is cool. I work with computers.
Nice know any good scam software?
No, sorry. What else do you like to do?
Work construction and have three children I love and take care of.
That sounds pretty busy! I usually just read and listen to music.
Thats nice check out my music on youtube. Dj k jae and microphone mafia.
I'll have to do that..
Thank you. And hope you enjoy and take care of yourself. Bless.
Dj Kahbib will be live on youtube in 7 hours, I think you'd like his music!
Wow thanks, i will definitely check it out!
What kind of music do you have on YouTube? I'd like to check it out!
Oh its just some experimental electronica stuff i like to mess around with when i have time
That sounds really cool! I like electronica. Never got into dubstep though. I like to listen to music while I'm riding my bike.
Yeah i think dubstep is an aquired taste ha. I like it also for working out. Gets you pumped.
Yes! I have a mix of Skrillex and David Guetta that really make the ride to work go by fast.
Ha, guess it helps if your late! Have you rode in any competitions recently?
Nope. I don't like biking competitively - I prefer to compete with myself and challenge myself, you know? What do you do for exercise?
I run as much as i can, then just lifting to get toned. I hear you on challenging yourself though
With your music and your job and your kids it must be hard to find time to workout! I need to do more lifting myself.
Well luckily, well maybe ha, i get a lot of running in chasing the kids!
