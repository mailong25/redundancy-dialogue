Hi.
Hello.
How is your day going so far?
I've been chasing my two twins around all day, so I'm ready for bedtime. How about you?
I have been driving around a lot today.
Do you have any plans for the weekend?
I think I am going to an art museum.
That sounds fun! I'm going to try and play tennis and go to church on sunday.
Tennis is fun. I'm not that good at it though. I like to play badminton.
I've never played that. I'm originally from sweden and we play a lot of tennis there.
It's actually really run and fast paced. I have a cousin that just moved to sweden..
I'm sure he'll love it there. I moved to the us around 12 years ago.
She does love it. She says it is very different from here. She loves the coffee breaks.
Do you have any children?
What type of church do you attend?
I attend a Methodist church, it's a small but I like and they have a great Sunday School for my kids.
That sounds very quaint. I'm personally an atheist. Were you raised into religion?
I wasn't raised with religion, Sweden is primarlyy a non-religious country, but when I moved to the United States my husband attended church every Sunday and I started going with him.
Why did you decide to move to the United States?
I had a great job opportunity here after I graduated from university. Also, Sweden is very cold! Have you ever been to Sweden?
My cousin lives there but I've never been lucky enough to visit him. What job opportunity did you move for?
I work in medicine and was offered a great fellowship with a hospital here. My job gives me great flexibility so I can still make time for my kids and my hobbies including tennis.
Wow that's interesting. Do you have a specific area of medicine you work in? I work as a scientist. I'm not very good at tennis but I keep practicing!
