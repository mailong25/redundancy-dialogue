Hello! What do you do for a living?
I live on a large farm with beans and corn.
Cool. How many siblings do you have?
None, maybe because my father is a preacher.
I'm an only child too. I do have two dogs though.
I do like dogs, do you like country music? It's my favorite.
I like country music. By the way..do you grow beans and corn?
Yes and I like to drive trucks and tractors around on the farm. Tractors being my favorite.
That would be fun. My dad was in the navy.
That's cool. Winter is my favorite time of the year, what about you?
We didn't have much winter since growing up I was in school in france and spain.
Cool, but with the farm and my father being a preacher not much traveling for me.
I had an argument with my Dad yesterday. He still thinks I should join the Navy.
I think you should do whatever you please!
Thank you for that encouragement. Thats so nice. How are you?
Good thanks. Just got home from work actually! Truck driving can be exhausting on your behind.
Are you driving the truck for the farm or another job? I hate being in a car for a long time. Makes my behind go numb.
Yep, I transport food to and fro! It's good honest work but I won't lie, I think it ages my body a bit. Do you ever listen to country music in the car?
Oh nice. I'm sure it is hard on your body. Thats the only music I listen to when I am driving. Do you have a favorite country song?
Yeah! My favorite country song is anything by Billy Ray Cyrus! How about you?
I like his new song, I Want My Mullet Back. I'm a Garth Brooks lover. I Got Friends in Low Places is my favorite probably.
ME TOO! I love Garth Brooks as well. Any good music artists in France and Spain?
I used to know them all but now I only listen to American music.
Cool. Did you live there because of your dad?
