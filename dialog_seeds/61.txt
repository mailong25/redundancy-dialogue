Hello have you ever seen the show extreme couponing itâ€™s my favorite.
Yes I love that show really helps when you have lots of different food to buy.
My coupon habit has let me buy food for all my animals and paint supplies.
I love to read lots of books.
Going to college full time sometimes makes it hard to get into a good book.
That's true. What are your hobbies or other interests?
Besides taking sunset walks I enjoy spending time with my 5 dogs and 3 rats.
Sounds very interesting. I enjoy riding my bike.
I could paint you riding your bike.
That would be nice. Do you listen to music while painting?
No I do not.
Since your a student, if you need your computer fixed, I'm your guy.
What books have you been recently recently then?
I have been reading some classics, like To Kill a Mockingbird and The Great Gatsby. Have you read those?
Yes! 3 of my dogs' names are Scout, Daisy, and Gatsby! Those are my absolute favorites.
Wow that is amazing. They are some really well-written books. Have you seen the movies accompanying those books?
I have. I liked both of the versions of The Great Gatsby. Did you like either the older or newer one better if you've seen them?
I have seen both, but I have to go with the newer one. I think Leonardo Dicaprio is a terrific actor.
I do too! I can't believe it took so long for him to get an Oscar. He chooses very good diverse roles. Is he your favorite actor?
He is one of them, along with John Krasinski who is most famous for his role in The Office.
I love The Office! It got me through finals, and John Krasinski is wonderful. I like his Good News Network stuff.
I'll have to check that out! Is it a relief to have finally gotten through finals, I'm sure you have been busy?
With 8 pets, I'm always busy. Do you have any pets?
I have two dogs. They are a handful, but I am able to cuddle up with them and read a good book which is always fun!
