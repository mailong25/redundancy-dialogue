Peace! How are you?
Hi I'm ok getting ready for work you?
Putting on my hiking boots and heading into the woods. You like to hike?
Not really I prefer to stay home and drink. Do u have kids?
I am waiting for my neighbor john to decide he wants to make babies with me.
Haha I see I will be a dad soon.
I hope we make a beautiful world of equal opportunity for your kid.
Hopefully. I work in a garage what do u do for work?
I quit my job becasue my boss was mean. I hate mean people.
Do u like to drink? It runs in my family.
Not much. It makes people mean, and I'm not mean.
True some people do get mean.
Do you have hobbies other than drinking, I mean.
Besides working on cars not many how bout u?
Did you work on any cool cars today?
Not today! I mostly worked on Toyotas this week. But I do have a vintage Ferrari coming in next week.
that sounds sweet. I wished I was mechanically inclined and could work on cars. That would be a nice job to have.
I could definitely give you pointers here and there! Honestly, just knowing how to change your oil, take care of tires, and refill your fluids goes a long way.
My neighbor John changes my oil. That tells you how much I know about cars.
John seems like a great guy! Do you guys ever hang out?
not really, he has kids and I don't. So we have nothing really to do together.
Well, I'm sure if he ever gets a free moment you guys could go out for tacos or a hike or something. Have you hiked anywhere cool recently?
just local trails. So how are you feeling about being a new Dad?
I'm both super scared and super psyched at the same time. Everything is about to change and I have no idea what to expect
I imaging it changes a lot. But you'll be fine because father instincts will kick in.
I certainly hope so. All the diapers will be worth it when I can teach how to do all the things I enjoy!
