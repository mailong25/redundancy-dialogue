Hello, I am a swimmer.
I am a musician.
Cool, what instrument do you play? I played the clarinet in highschool.
I dont have a cat though I have a rabbit hes absolutely adorable.
Cool, I just have a dog.
Cool,im a huge animal lover I dont discriminate,ive owned just about every animal.
That is really cool, I would have a lot of pets if I had the time.
Yeah.i have a strict landlord though,whos really a hypocrite.
That's a shame, does the landlord not like pets?
No,he dosent I think he needs one then he wouldn't get drunk so much maybe.
That sounds really sad, I am sorry.
Yeah,hes not a bad guy he just has a drinking problem.
Does your rabbit enjoy listening to you play your music?
Sometimes, haha. Sometimes he goes in his house and hides for a bit. But I usually don't play in the same room as him.
Your rabbits so cute! Have you tried playing music for rabbits? My dog loves it when I play relaxing music for dogs.
I haven't intentionally tried to play music for him, but maybe I'll give it a try! Aww! That's so sweet What does your dog like the most?
I usually find a random playlist on youtube and search music for dogs haha! I think he looks the most peaceful when it's soft classical music.
That's precious! Does he enjoy your clarinet playing?
Unfortunately, no, he leaves the room when I used to play often. What instrument do you play?
Oh no! Dogs do have sensitive ears so that's probably it. I currently play the saxophone. But I know how to play trumpet and violin as well.
Haha that makes sense. You're so talented! Maybe we should meetup and play together sometime. I'm a bit rusty with the clarinet.
You're talented too! I firmly believe being able to play instrument is talent in itself. I'm down! I haven't played trumpet in a long time.
That's so sweet of you to say! Let's hangout this weekend, maybe bring your rabbit to meet my dog, haha!
Haha, I would, but he doesn't like dogs. they scare him. But please do bring your pup along!
