Hi! How are you doing today?
Hi! I've been better. I have to move next month to a new state.
I am so sorry to hear that. Do you love where you live now?
Yes, but my dad lost his job as headmaster at my school..
My dad lost his job last year. All he kept was his blue dodge truck.
It's rough. But my school is so strict maybe this school will be looser.
I bet it will. I want to go back to school. I'm a part-time plumber.
What do you want to do? My sisters are all older then me and in college.
Honestly? Watch sunsets during the summer. What job lets me do that?
Park ranger? Lol do you like sports? I love the bears!
I like sports, mostly basketball. I love eating poached eggs.
I've never had a poached egg! I usually do scrambled with cheese.
I eat them every morning on the balcony of my 32nd floor apartment.
Oh wow I bet you have a great view!
Did you start packing today?
I did, thanks for asking! My dad and sisters all came to help me pack. How's your day been?
My day is going well so far. I have to go to work later tonight, it is a big job and could lead to full time.
I hope it does! You've been working so hard and deserve more.
Thank you. I can finally go back to school if it pans out. How are you doing with the school move?
It worked out well. All that has to be done is finishing the packing and saying my goodbyes. We need to see each other before I leave!
I'm glad to hear it is going good. Maybe we can get a game of hoops in this weekend.
Come over Saturday morning! We can eat some eggs and then play a few games.
That sounds great. I will teach you how to make poached eggs finally! I think the Bears game is on as well.
I would love to try one! They look so tasty. That sounds like a great day planned. I can't wait!
Me too!! My dad said I can use his truck to help you move any big stuff if you need.
Awesome! Does your dad wanna come over and catch up with my dad as well?
