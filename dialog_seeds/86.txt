Hello, I'm from seattle wa.
Hi I'm from fl.
Nice, what do you do there?
I am a tax attorney, not the most exciting job. But I enjoy the challenge.
That is interesting, I am a freelance writer.
Cool what do you usually write?
I don't have a specific genre mostly web content articles.
Ok. During my free time I run. Cross country mostly, but training for a marathon now.
I like to sleepin a lot haha.
Lol because of the tedious nature of work I like to be active otherwise.
I understand that, but I like sports too.
Great. I also enjoy eating high protein food to build lean muscles, like fish.
That's cool to hear because I like to fish.
Great what the largest one that got away. Lol.
I'm going fishing- do you want one?
Sure! If you have enough to spare. They are a good source of protein.
Absolutely - I would love to share. I usually catch more than I can consume. Any ideas how you might cook it?
I usually like to filet it and cook it in the skillet with some blackening seasoning. What about you?
I do something very similar and use it over my salad - it takes like New Orleans to me. Any awesome runs lately?
Oh I haven't even thought about making it for a salad. I need to try that! Lately, no but I have one scheduled later this summer.
That's great. I would love to do long runs but I simply get bored after about a mile.
That's understandable. But hey fishing is a great outdoor activity!
True - one would also argue that's its boring, but I find it calming and relaxing. Reminds me of summer with my grandfather.
I can fish for about an hour and then my attention span is lost, but my brother could literally fish all day. It calms him like you mentioned also!
Does your brother run? Or is that something you just find enjoyable?
Eh, he does some, but he's more of a gym rat haha
