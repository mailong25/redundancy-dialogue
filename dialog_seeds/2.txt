Hi how are you?
Great, yourself?
Good, do you like to paint? I do!
I'm not much of a painter, I prefer horses. What do you paint?
People playing music since I like to do that as well!
My ancestor had a song written about him. He was an american civil war general.
Wow that is really interesting.
Do you like fruit? I love to eat fruit.
I do like fruit! It's not expensive and it helps me to live within a budget.
Budgets are important! Especially when dealing with such large animals as horses.
Oh I'm sure. I love animals, like people!
I like people, unlike my father. He rarely smiles which makes socializing difficult.
Sounds like my boss. I wish I didn't have one.
Oh, what do you do? Bosses can be tough to deal with.
So which civil war general was your ancestor, anyway?
General Nathan Bedford Forrest. My cousin was named after him.
Really, that is amazing...I was actually thinking of painting General Forrest as my next project.
That's quite a coincidence! Do you paint a lot of civil war scenes?
No, but I was looking for subjects in a book and came across him as someone who had a song written about him so thought the linkage to music and people was there. Also, his old photos have amazing facial lines.
Yes, they do. Did you know he was in the cavalry? that's one of the reasons I like horses. You should paint him on his horse!
Great idea, but for some reason, I can't paint animals. Tried to do a cat once and ended up looking like a emaciated fox!
That's a shame. I tried to paint fruit once and it looked like a cat!
I'll stick to painting people and you stick to eating fruit! Have you been able to grown any fruit trees?
I tried to grown an orange tree, but somebody cut it down. I probably shouldn't have planted it on my neighbor's property.
Yeah, that makes sense. My neighbor got upset when I painted a picture of his wife so I get it.
Yeah, better play it safe and keep painting music instruments.
