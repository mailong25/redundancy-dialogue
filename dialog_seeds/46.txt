Hello, how are you fling?
Awesome!!! It is a wonderful day! And you?
Good thanks. Oops. Auto correct. Technology these days..
Lolz I like to keep things simple... Like dying my hair blue.
Oh that's quite a look. I'm too old for that. 5 grandkids now.
Wow I'm only just about to turn 29 next week sooooo... Not quite there!
Yup 65 here. Love going to the beach still though..
Me to! I'm heading out of town for spring break and going to the beach!!
Nice. I'm sure that will be fun. What music do you like?
Everything, I was just loading up a playlist for my new car(present from mom yay!).
Lucky you. I wish. I like the styx and journey. Lol.
Most underrated bands of their time!.
Yeah there is a lot of good ones. So what kind of car did you get?
A blue one? Lol I'm not into cars.
How does your new car drive? Is it fast?
It is! Seatbelts are required lol
Haha, I'd definitely make sure to wear a seatbelt if I'm in a fast car, for sure. What model and make is your new car?
It is a 2021 porsche 911. It's awesome!
Wow! That's a fancy car--I bet it's great! What's it's max speed?
200 mph! I doubt I will get to that speed though :)
Yeah, I don't imagine it's legal to drive that fast on the highway. Now, if you take it to a racetrack, I'm sure you could run it up to that speed!
That is a great idea! I will google for a local track!
I bet you'll attract a lot of attention there--you with your blue Porsche 911 going at a whopping 200 mph!
No kidding! I am hardly discrete in it!
Maybe you can even bring a few friends, or a date, around for your joyride!
Great idea! I will make some good plans for the weekend :)
