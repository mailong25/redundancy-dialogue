Hi, I want to talk to you about god.
Do you speak more than one language, I do.
Well, yes, I speak a little spanish, un poco.
That's cool I speak both spanish and english very fluently.
Magnifico! I need to talk to some of my workers in spanish, daily.
Ah, so you must be older than me as I am still in school.
Yes, I am middle-aged and work in a clothing factory with lots of menial workers.
What do you do in your spare time, I like to hike and walk on the beach.
I am a workaholic, but when my brother and kids are around we go there.
I'm moving houses next week so hopefully my family will help with that.
Every time I have moved, I have had a friend to help me, which is nice.
That is nice to have friends you can count on.
Are you all packed up ready for your house move this week?
Almost! I'm living in a maze of boxes right now, haha. But I'm excited to get settled into the new place.
It is exciting to move. Moving also makes your realize how much stuff you have accumulated over the years, lol
Exactly! Haha. I have three huge boxes full of things I realized I don't need anymore to donate.
Same here, I have a lot of stuff that I don't need but have a hard time getting rid of.
We all have that one category of things we have too much of. I have too many books! What do you have too much of?
We are the same. I have a lot of books too. I just like having books.
Me too! I can't get through books fast enough. Do you get enough time to read outside of work?
I wish I had enough time to leisurely read. I only been reading a book to learn Spanish from.
I'm impressed that you're learning Spanish! I am learning a bit of Spanish, too. There's so many new ways to learn languages these days. Have you also looked into free apps that help teach you Spanish?
I am too old to use apps, haha. I only use books
No problem with that! Are you finding it easy or hard to learn?
