Do you like gaming. I am a big fan.
My kids play games but I don't play much. I love to watch movies!.
Oh really what is their favorite game?
I think it's called fortnite. I sometimes watch while cooking healthy meals. What's yours?
The best game I like to play is alistar.
Never heard of it. Old timer here! Just turned 30. What other things do you like?
Gaming is all my life, in fact, I just got a new laptop for it.
You're just like my kids! That's all they do. Do you like your new laptop?
Oh yeah I do, I will really like to meet your kids someday.
Maybe someday! It has been really nice talking to you.
Yes and for me too. What device do your kids play with??
Their dad bought them a playstation 4 for christmas this past year. They love it!
I just broke a new record on Alistar!
Woohoo.... we’re you playing on your new laptop?
Yes! It is perfect for gaming!!
That’s great... I might just get my kids a laptop for Christmas;)
You spoil them during for the holidays! They are lucky to have you as such a generous parent!
They are good kids.... I feel blessed and Christmas is the only time I indulge them haha
You only live once! Do you ever play fortnite with them?
I have been meaning too but never got around to it. They have been pestering me ... to be honest I’m scared lol
Fortnite is really fun. It is action packed!
Do you think it might be a good one to introduce a newbie to the gaming world... I’m clueless
Yes! You will be totally addicted within minutes :)
Alright the.... my kids are in for a surprise... I’m all juiced up to get cracking w/ Fortnite!
