Hello, how is it goin?
Great! How about you?
Great. Are you male or female?
Female, love to have fun going places and trying new things. What about you?
I am more of a family man, I love spending time with my sons.
I have two sons myself. They are the true loves of my life.
I agree, the best thing that has happened to me in my life.
Do you like music? My tastes vary greatly...maroon 5, the rolling stones, brad paisley, luke bryant.
I am lifelong fan of tupac shakur.
Wow! What about your social life? Dinner and a movie or concerts and dancing?
Yes, I love all kinds of cuisines mexican, italian, chinese.
Love chinese and italian!! Mexican kills my stomach.
I found a great new Chinese restaurant last night!
Oh that's great! What's it called?
China Dragon. I know... Corny name, but it was great. They have the best szechuan beef in the world.
Really? It's hard to believe that, but I guess I'll take your word on it. Did you bring your boys there?
Yeah. They love Chinese food too. They both had been out of town for a while, so it was good to see them.
Ah, that's great. Only one of my sons loves Chinese food as much as I do. The other really just likes Italian food, so it can be difficult to decide where to go.
It sounds like an international fight!! My sons just got back from studying abroad. They are leaving again in a few months.
It's nice that you got to spend some time with them. I'd be so worried if my boys traveled so far away. Luckily it will be a long time before they're old enough.
It's stressful and I worry all the time, but I am happy for them. Enjoying them while you can. They grow up fast.
Oh yeah, definitely. Where have your boys been studying?
They have been in Spain and they are going to Italy next. The European tour!!
My younger son would be so jealous. They must be eating really well over there!
