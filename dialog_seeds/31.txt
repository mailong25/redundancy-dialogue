How was class today? What are you studying?
Class was the same as usual. I'm studying English and hope to write books about Jiu-jitsu and martial arts!
That's great to hear your class went ok. That sounds very intriguing! Remember me when you make it big and famous!
Haha I'll send you a signed copy of my first book! You'll probably make it famous in tech before me!
I'd love that! Thank you. Haha, who knows maybe we can both make it big and help each other out somehow.
I just thought of an even better idea. You make the website and I'll do the writing!
It sounds like we have a business plan made up already!
How serious are you about this? We might have to meet up to talk this over!
I'm down if you are! They always say that two heads are better than one.
I'm so excited! Let's meet on the weekend somewhere in the city!
Ok! How about on Sunday afternoon? We can make a start up plan on paper.
That works with me! We can go for a bike ride too!
