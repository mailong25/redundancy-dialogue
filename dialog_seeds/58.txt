Hello, how are you today?
Great and you?
Good, just finished eating some chocolate ice cream.
Chocolate ice cream, yumm that's about the same color as my hair ;-).
My dad had brown hair too; he was in the military.
I love my family, my mother works with special needs clients.
That's awesome! I just read a book about autism; I love to read.
Me too! But I had no choice growing up latina, mom always pushed education.
Same for me. Maybe that's why I work for a small nonprofit that helps underprivileged youths.
Lol I kind of went the other route and became a healer.
That's awesome. Well, it was nice talking with you today!
It really was fun, thanks!
I was at the book store and found a great new book to read on the advantages of working with youth in the community.
Oh wow that sounds awesome, what are some of the tips they give?
I haven't started it yet, so I am not sure, but I will fill you in once I read it! How was your day today, what exactly do you do as a healer?
Basically it is a therapy type thing. I listen to people vent about their problems and give them advice that helps them clear their mind.
That sounds interesting. Where did you go to do your training to become a healer?
I got my degree in mindfulness at the local community college, I then trained under a healer at a local therapy location
Oh that's great! What do you like to do when you are not healing people?
I really enjoy reading, a big fan of biography books
I love to read too, but I am more interested in fiction. What is the best biography you have read?
The best auto-biography I ever read was about the life of Martin Luther King Jr. Super inspiring. What is your favorite fiction book?
I bet that book was extremely inspiring! I love murder mysteries right now, but my all time favorite book would have to be To Kill a Mockingbird.
To Kill a Mockingbird is an absolutely legendary book, something everyone needs to read.
