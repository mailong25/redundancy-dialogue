I'm thinking of writing a love story set a Japanese internment camp between two teenagers.
Sounds very unique. Do you have an interest in Japan?
I do! I've actually been once and would love to go again. Would you ever travel to Japan?
Yes I am intrigued by the country and I love how technology is a part of everyday life there.
Yes! I agree it's so cool how advanced their use of tech in every day society is. Do you enjoy any Japanese video games?
My favorite is the final fantasy games. They are the best. What is your favorite game?
I love the final fantasy games! But my personal favorite is probably any game from Kingdom Hearts
Can't believe I have not played any of those games. What are they about?
They actually feature a lot of Final Fantasy characters! I guess you could say it's Final Fantasy's cousin. It's about three kids on an island who get pulled into a world of Disney characters and a mysterious dark force they need to fight.
OMG I need to play this game!
