I am a vegitarian that likes eating fruit.
I like to eat fruit too. Are you male or female?
I am a male that likes smiling just like my father.
I am female and I have a lot of friends.
I dont like keeping friends because my father is an old civil war general.
You must be old. What do you do for fun?
I do it with avid horse.
That sounds expensive. I try not to spend too much money.
You are just like me do you also detest breaking wind in public.
Lol, I don't like to do that either.
I love pineapple alot what about you.
I work from home so I can eat pineapple whenever. I like to be my own boss.
Same here, I dont want a boss to frown at me.
I like most everyone.
I cut up two pineapples today.
Oh yeah, how were they?
Pretty good, i was going to add them to a fruit salad but i couldnt resist and ate em all!
That figures. They have a great taste and juice to drink as well. Bonus they don't make either of us break wind.
Well that is a good bonus. Did you know pineapples are the only fruit that can eat you?
Really? That seems like that can't be true unless the other items we classify as fruit aren't technically fruit.
They have a special enzyme that is used in digestion! Thats why people put it on meats to cook.
Wow did not know that was the reason. Learn something new everyday. So which side of the civil war did your father side with?
The winning side ha. Hows your working from home treating you? I know you love being your own boss now
It's fantastic, i tend to my garden in hopes this year will be a good year for everything and not just tomatoes. Not dealing with daily commutes is nice too.
I hear that! I wish i could do the same,
I use cardboard egg shell cartons, mixture of planting soil and dirt from my yard, mix the two together, plant anywhere from 2-3 seed per section and cover it in saran wrap for a week.
