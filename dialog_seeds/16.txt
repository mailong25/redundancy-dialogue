Hi there! How are you?
I am fine, it is stressful leaving the state.
Oh no! I bet. It would be hard for me as I am so shy.
Oh really I like meeting people a lot. Well I am moving next month.
That's too bad. Where are you going?.
Neighboring state. I like the weather there..
Is it warmer? I always wanted to go to florida, but my dad was too overprotective.
Oh yeah, and it does not snow heavily..
Good! I shop online to avoid going out in snow. I love doing that anyway.
I went to a strict school but it does not stop me from loving football.
I'm a homebody. I just stay home with my kids and watch movies. I love it.
You should be some mommy's boy. My dad used to bee the headmaster in my school.
My kids and I saw a very funny movie.
Nice... was it an animation movie?
You know me too well...yes! It was really cute with lovable characters. It is on Netflix and it's called Chloe. Watch it!
I sure will! I can’t believe I missed it on Netflix. Maybe tonight :)
It will cheer you up after a long work day, for sure!
Yup... that’s my favorite way to unwind!
Have you hired movers yet?
No, I’m just waiting to finish up with packing my stuff to have an idea of how much stuff. Probably by next week!
Moving can be stressful with so much to do. But, worth it once you settle into the new place!
True... it’s been crazy! Can’t wait to be all settled in at my new place.
Have you thought about a color scheme yet to decorate around?
Thankfully the interior decorator is taking care of that!
